## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **parsing and formatting nested JSON data** using Python.  
It demonstrates how to read a JSON file, extract required information, and solve multiple query-based tasks using loops, lists, and dictionaries.

The notebook contains **20 practice questions** based on real-world nested JSON structures:
- Company details
- Departments
- Employees
- Skills
- Salaries
- Locations

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and read nested JSON data using Python
- Extract values from multi-level JSON structure
- Perform analysis and transformation
- Create output using:
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Looping logic
  - String operations

---

## ✅ Tasks Covered (Questions 1–20)
Some key tasks included in the notebook:

- Print company name
- Count total departments
- Find departments having Python-skilled employees
- Count employees department-wise
- Identify highest paid employee
- Create mappings like:
  - Employee → Department
  - Employee → Skills string
  - Skill → Employees string
  - Employee → Reversed Name
  - Employee → Name length
- Print locations line-by-line

## 🚀 How to Run
  steps:
  
    - step: "Clone the repository"
      command: "git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Company-Nested-Json-Data-Parsing.git"

    - step: "Open the notebook"
      options:
        - "Jupyter Notebook"
        - "VS Code"
        - "Google Colab (upload the .ipynb file)"

    - step: "Verify JSON file path"
      note: "Ensure the JSON file path matches the notebook folder structure"

## 📌 Input Dataset

📍 JSON File Location:
```
data/company_nested_data.json
```
The JSON file contains nested data in the format:
Company → Departments → Employees → Skills


---

## 📈 Output:

- Each question prints its output as:
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Department-wise mappings
- Salary calculations
- Skill-based extraction

## ✅ Conclusion:
This project strengthened my understanding of nested JSON parsing in Python. By solving 20 structured questions, I practiced extracting multi-level data, applying transformations, and generating outputs using lists, dictionaries, loops, and string operations. This improved my confidence in handling real-world JSON datasets used in analytics and automation workflows.
